# protobuf-benchmarks
Some simple tests with various protobuf libraries

To get started run `vagrant up` then login to the machine by using `vagrant ssh`

The code will be in `/vagrant` and you can run the protbuf tests by going into the `php-protobuf` or `Protobuf-PHP` directories and running `php test.php`

A simple JSON profiler is in the root which benchmarks the PHP native JSON methods. Run it with `php json-profile.php`
